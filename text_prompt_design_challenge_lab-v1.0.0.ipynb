    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This challenge lab is designed to test your knowledge of calling Gemini and utilizing a few fundamental text prompt design techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two featured guides on prompting from the Google Cloud documentation are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Overview of prompting strategies](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/prompt-design-strategies) from the Generative AI on Vertex AI documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. [Prompt design strategies](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/prompting-strategies) from the Gemini API documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both contain good tips. You are encouraged to **bookmark them**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "You will demonstrate your ability to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Initialize Vertex AI in your environment\n",
    "- Load a generative model\n",
    "- Guide model output with a persona\n",
    "- Extract information to a schema\n",
    "- Stay on topic with fallback responses\n",
    "- Use examples to influence the model's response\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the following Python notebook cells have missing or incomplete code sections and tasks that need to be completed, indicated by the code comments starting with `# TODO`. Your challenge is to complete each cell, run it to test for correctness, and then move on. When all the cells are working, you have completed the challenge.\n",
